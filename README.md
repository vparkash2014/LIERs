# LIERs

My goal is to make all the scripts, jupyter notebooks, and data, I wrote/used for my second PhD project (HI galaxies with little star formation: an abundance of LIERs). The resultS was published in [Parkash et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.485.3169P/abstract).

**WARNING- This repository is still under-construction. I am currently "cleaning" my scripts and adding comments to them so it is easy for the community to read.**

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
